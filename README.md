# Parallel Computing using CUDA

This repository consists of implementations of various parallel algorithms using `CUDA`.

Each folder contains a `README.md` file containing the instructions to run the codes

#### List of algorithms implemented

- Sum of elements in an array using parallel reduction (Normal and Thrust Implementation)
- Addition of 2 arrays or matrices (Normal and Thrust Implementation)
- Gaussian Image Blurring Algorithm
- RGB to Gray Scale Image conversion
- Matrix Multiplication (Both Normal and Tiled Approach)
- Histogram of ASCII Character String
- Histogram of Integer Array (Normal and Thrust Implementation)
- Image Convolution
- 7 point Stencil
- Inclusive Prefix Scan on a 1D array (Normal and Thrust Implementation)
